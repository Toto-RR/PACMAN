## Our project

We’re going to replicate the game Pac-Man arrangement which was released in 1996 by Namco as part of the Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2 as a tribute. This project has been done by four catalan students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).

## About the game

PAC-MAN Arrangement is a 1996 videogame which was initially released as part of the Namco Classic Collection Volume 2. Nevertheless, it was later included in Pac-Man Collection, alongside several versions of Namco Museum.

Like the original Pac-Man, Pac-Man Arrangement is a maze game in which the objective is to clear all Pac-Dots on the board by eating them and avoiding hazardous contact with the ghosts that also inhabit the maze.

Pac-Man was created by videogame designer Toru Iwatani. Iwatani was inspired by a pizza that was missing a piece to create the famous protagonist of the saga. Its name comes from the onomatopoeia paku (パ ク) which represents the sound produced when the mouth is opened and closed. It was originally marketed in Japan under the name Puck-Man, but the American distributor Midway changed it to Pac-Man for the USA market, as puck looks like fuck.
